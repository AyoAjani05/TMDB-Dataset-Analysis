# Introduction To The TMDB Dataset
In This Project, I will be working with the TMDB movies dataset which was gathered between the years 1960 to 2015. The Dataset is which contains a large number of public data on films such as the title of the movie, the genre of the film, the ratings of the movie, the duration of the movie, actors, directors, the year of release of the movie tagline and much more.

# Research Questions To Be Answered.
- What is the name of the most popular movie?
- what are the names of the movies with the highest profit?
- Which Genre was most used from 1960 to 2015?
- Who are the most used actors?
- Does The Popularity Affect the Revenue Generated by The movie?
- Who are the most used directors?
- What is the number of movies released Yearly and total profit each Year?
- Does a shorter runtime increase revenue?
